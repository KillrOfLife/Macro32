# Macro32

The Macro32 is a macropad featuring a stm32.
This project was a way for me to learn how to integrate an IC of my choosing on my PCB.
It was also my fist project using kicad

## Take a look

[kicad project](https://kicanvas.org/?github=https://github.com/KillrOfLife/Macro32/blob/main/PCB/macro32.kicad_pro)

## How can I make it myself

Great question!
Go look in the github releases for the latest tag
There you should find the downloads for the PCB production files (aka gerbers)
And the STL's for the case parts if you want that too. (you may need to download the source code)

## How to assemble

For any help assembling this macropad refer to the [build guide](https://github.com/KillrOfLife/Macro32/blob/main/buildguide.md).
